add cuda timer events
(cuda protips)https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/category/cuda-pro-tip/
build basic cuda path tracer
coheleased memory access using float4
use thrust for various datastructures
See if time permits construction on GPU
https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/thinking-parallel-part-iii-tree-construction-gpu/
Correct Aliasing issues
use cuda streams
add support for data structures(BVH)
add support for FPS display
profile with nvidia profiler
Make sure no printing inside critical loops
Experiment with different data types
Cleanup code and commented stuff
remove assimp stuff
Organize Gpu Code
Add Gpu Box

Prep up the CPU Code
Remove long headers comments from other files





GUI Design
=>optimize packing data for efficient retrival on GPU
=>Cuda controls(Ray depth,Samples,block size)
Interactive Samples,Interactive Depth
=>Display stuff like kernel execution time,texture mapping
=>Gl controls(Fog)
=>BackFace Culling

Stuff We did
(Presentation Slides)
A slideShow Showing the project evolving
=>Basic Ray Tracer=>Load Objects=>Depth Check=>


Overview of Collision Algorithms
// http://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/minimal-ray-tracer-rendering-simple-shapes/ray-box-intersection
// optimised code from http://www.gamedev.net/topic/495636-raybox-collision-intersection-point

Final Submission
//clean and build and get rid of all warnings
Report additions
=>Initial Depth Depth testing with Cornell Box
=>bilateral rendering for cpu vs gpu
=>Basic GPU implementation(=>recursion overhead avoided with loops)
=>Speedup curves
=>timing data for kernels and total gpu time and cpu comparisions
=>Speedup should be shown with 2-3 methods and graphs to accompany
=>Basic Loop Addition
=>Write about GUI controls
=>Optimizations avoid branching by using arr of function ptrs
