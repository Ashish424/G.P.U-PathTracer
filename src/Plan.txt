add cuda timer events
build basic cuda path tracer
use thrust for various datastructures
use cuda streams
add support for data structures(BVH)
add support for FPS display
profile with nvidia profiler
Make sure no printing inside critical loops
Experiment withg different data types



GUI Design
=>basic Camera Controls
=>optimize packing data for efficient retrival on GPU

=>Cuda controls(Ray depth,Samples,block size)
Interactive Samples,Interactive Depth

=>Gl controls(Fog)

Report additions
=>Basic GPU implementation(=>recursion overhead avoided with loops)
=>Speedup curves
=>timing data for kernels and total gpu time and cpu comparisions





[DONE]setup cuda and opengl interop
